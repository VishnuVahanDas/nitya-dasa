# Nitya Dāsa

This repository will host the source code for **Nitya Dāsa**, a Flutter-based mobile application to help practitioners manage and track their daily devotional activities.

Key planned features include:

- **Personalized daily schedules** with reminders for key practices
- **Japa counter** and progress tracking
- **Scripture reading plans** and references
- **Event calendar** for temple or community activities
- **Push notifications** for important updates
